## Geospatial

I got into geospatial in 2022. It was a natural transition after mastering data science with python and business intelligence tools. I found that geography is a critical element to understanding the world both at the macro and micro levels. This allows for significant improvement in efficiency. Let's not take this for granted. Geospatial technology as we have it ubiquitously today is still very new. While we had GNSS and software for decades. Nowadays, it is available not only to large organizations but also to someone like you and I. GO to geospatial section to see some of my story maps that I migrated from Esri product to open science. 

## Data Science

I began my data science journey in late 2018. I was networking in D.C. when I realized I had to learn coding. I started with HarvardX mooc learning R by a biostatistician. I was anxious going into it at the beggining as a nontechnical person, but it was amazing. It was more like playing a video game than doing math or coding. I think it helped that I took statistics in college because there are a lot of statistics. However, using a programming language is very powerful. It was eye openning for someone who had only done excel analysis prior. It was a game changer. Of course, I had to switch to python a year later. I also learned sql, database design, business intelligence, and IT service management. 

## Business Intelligence
I enrolled in a business intelligence certificate program after the moocs. The program was very interesting. It allowed me to understand the business development cycle of tech solutions for large organizations according to ITIL standards. I then enrolled in a training program with ServiceNow training. Inititally, I wanted to do some of the high demand jobs like a system administrator or developer. The market was great for such jobs. However, covid came and casued  changes. I took the time to learn python. This was a transformational moment.
